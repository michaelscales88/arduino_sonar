The major takeaway from this project was learning how to make several unrelated devices work with one another. This was done through the use of interrupts and timers on the arduino, as well as mapping pins to the correct ports. It turns out doing all of that is fairly difficult using AVR assembly language.

Ideas for future arduino projects include a cheap, low-power seismometer, a portable weather station, or even a more robust version of this very project.
