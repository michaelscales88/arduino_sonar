The ultrasonic distance sensor can be used in a wide variety of applications. Many people utilize the sensor to build projects that can move around and avoid obstacles, accurately measure distances, and notify about incoming objects.

Car backup sensors and high-end side mirrors use ultrasonic sensors to notifiy of nearby cars and objects. Sound waves above 20kHz (well above human hearing) are sent out in pulses and then the reflection of these pulses are timed and then used to measure distances. Sometimes these pulses are in excess of 100dB to ensure clear reception (wow!).
